    Items are shuffled before they are divided into two groups. The forget
    batches contain stereotype sentences from the first group; the retain
    batches contain anti-stereotype sentences from the second group. When
    ``split`` is false, both sentence sets are taken from the second group.

    Args:
        cat_type: StereoSet category to load (for example, ``intrasentence``).
        paths: JSON files whose ``data[cat_type]`` entries should be combined.
        batch_size: Maximum number of sentences in each returned batch. The
            final batch may contain fewer sentences.
        split: Whether to use separate groups for forgetting and retaining.

    Returns:
        A pair ``(forget_batches, retain_batches)``. Each value is a list of
        sentence batches, and each batch is a list of sentence dictionaries.
